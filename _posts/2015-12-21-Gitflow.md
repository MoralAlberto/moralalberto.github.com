Spend awhile since I learned **Git** and it's incredibly useful in my day to day projects. (I was a fool for not learning earlier ü§îü§î).
<br/>
A few years ago I lost my precious hard drive with all my old projects (mention that they aren't in any online repository like Bitbucket, Github or any similar), now, I save absolutly all at **Bitbucket** or **Github**.


> The Gitflow defines a very basic workflow, we have different branches and each branch has their specific commitment.

There could be a more different approaches in your **Gitflow**, I'll explain a brief description about the most important branches.
<br/>
<br/>

**MASTER**, our masterpiece, "untouchable". When a new release is finished, all the change are merged once to this branch (one merge per tag), so you can see the list of commits for each version.

<br/>
<br/>
**DEVELOP**, in this branch there must be a **valid code**, at least a compile code (without warnings or crashes at runtime), this branch is the parent branch for the new
features in our project, i.e: **your product owner (PO) wants a new feature in our app**, so, the developer who has assigned this new feature must create a new branch
with a  specific and "unique" name, if you're using a project tracking software like JIRA, it's recommended to create a branch's name with the task's code and two or three worlds (or a little description). **Not only you create a new branch for new features, also you create branches to fix bugs**.
<br/>
When a developer finishes his/her feature (or most widely: a task), it's a good practise to make a **Code Review**, this means that, the whole team can see the coworker's code before merging into **Develop**. Even more, the team has to approve their coworker's code to merge into **Develop**, or decline if there're typos or a bad pattern design, or... whatever.

<br/>
Examples of branch's names

  - **feature/MXZ-10_Login_Authentication**
  - **Bugfixing/MXZ-24_Error_login**

<br/>
<br/>
**RELEASE**, imagine that a new feature it's finished or it's time to release a new version of our app, this new version of our app will be released to QA's department (there're different environments to release a new version: *DEVELOPMENT*, *TEST*, *PRODUCTION*, etc but in this example the context is the *TEST* environment, because is the first filter to other environments)
<br/>
**Note: we create this Release branch from develop with all the features up to date.**

<br/>
If QA's department find bugs, this bugs could be fixed at **Release** branch or if they're not critical, at **Develop** branch. When the QA team have approved the **Release** version, we finish that **Release**. It means that, a new tag is generated and all changes are merged to **Master**, also the Gitflows tell us that all improvements (bugfixings) fixed at **Release** branch must be merged into **Develop** too, so, all developers can keep up coding knowing that all the bugs that were fixed at **Release** branch, won't appear in the next release version (false, because we can have regression üòÅ)

<br/>
<br/>
**HOTFIX**, if a bug is found in **Master** when the app is on **Production**, a new branch is created from **Master**. When the bug is fixed we can merge directly to **Master** (this is the unique case that developers can merge their code to **Master**) and also to **Develop**, we want all this changes into develop too.
