Day after day I try to be a better iOS developer. There isn't an easy way to achieve it, **but during my last year I learned some tips that can be useful, especially those which have worked for me**.

<br/>
My job is close from home. It only takes me 15 minutes to arrive there, so meanwhile I take my mobile phone and **I read advanced articles from different iOS communities that keep me updated** ([iOS Goodies](http://ios-goodies.com), [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com), [objc.io](https://www.objc.io), personal blogs such as [Natasha the robot](http://natashatherobot.com), [Krzystof Zablocki](http://merowing.info), etc) . There is really some good stuff on them.

<br/>
Three days a week I wake up early and I run 4-6 miles. While I was running I was just listening to the music (big Spotify fan). However, nowadays **I listen to audiobooks in order to improve my English listening skills**, (and yes, I do pay for the audiobooks), [Everything That Remains](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/everything-that-remains/id786759360?mt=11) or [Steve Jobs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/audiobook/steve-jobs/id473960366)

<br/>
**I also like to experiment with cool articles that I read in different blogs** (blogs like those I have mentioned above). What do I learn? tips, different mobile architecture patterns, tests, continuous delivery, continuous integration, etc. I also think that **learning by doing is important**. Sometimes I read something that is interesting but if I don't code it is impossible to understand it at all to me. So, I benefit form my spare time to code and keep on improving.

<br/>
There are seasons in the year that I'm too busy; workdays are hard. When I arrive home, there's no way to code to me since I do my best at work. Thus, I haven't the time I wished to keep on coding. **That's why I try to develop new things during the weekend.**

<br/>
Other key learnings I've learned during this last year are, **try to learn as much as you can from your coworkers, BE HUMBLE**. Trust me; By being humble, you'll be more open-minded and, thus, freer. You'll learn much more things you expected to do. Even if your coworkers are juniors, there might be things that you learn about them: tips, new resources, etc.

<br/>
I recommend you to be an active user at Github, or StackOverflow. **Use Github in order to create open source projects and cooperate with other awesome developers** (ask if you don't know how to use a repository). **StackOverflow is a great source to search code questions or to answer them**.

<br/>
As you can see, I just created a new blog, **I will write entirely in English to improve my skills** and to spread my knowledge over the iOS Community.

> Coding is my passion. I love what I do and I hope I can do it as long as possible.

<br/>
<h2>Summary</h2>

- **Read a lot (iOS communities and advanced books)**.
- **Put in practice what you have learned. (Learning by doing method)**.
- **Share your knowledge**.
