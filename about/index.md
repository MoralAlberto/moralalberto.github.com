# Work Experience

#### iOS Mobile Developer at Zyncro, Barcelona
Architectural design and development of Zyncro Messenger iOS application: a private instant messaging app similar to WhatsApp or Telegram for companies.
Working with SCRUM, using technologies such as **XMPP**, **Socket.IO**, **CoreData**, **ReactiveCocoa** (Functional Reactive Programming), **Mantle**, **CocoaPods**, **Carthage** and **Git**, among others.

**Continuous delivery** and **continuous integration**: **Fastlane** and **Jenkins** respectively.

#### Co-founder at Couplace, Barcelona
Architectural design and development of Zyncro Messenger iOS and Android application: a private instant messaging app for couples.
Using technologies such as **XMPP(ejabberd)**, **CoreData**, **CocoaPods**, **Smack**, **Volley** and **Git**, among others.

The app offered a list of different plans, shared calendar to annotate important dates, private gallery and the social part to follow another
couples and see a wall with the items shares like photos, videos, events, etc.

#### Research at Department of Telecommunications, UAB
The Goal of the Project: ***Detection and prediction of abnormal physical activities over people who have some dependency needs*** (old people or disabled people)
through Machine Learning techniques adapted to Smartphone.
The Project was focused on a first data collecting received from the mobile device accelerometer and its further data sending to a server.
This server was the one which detected the activity by the user registered trough Machine Learning.

While developing this project, the research team opted for a new concept based on teleassistance technologies which enables users to monitor the physical activity of other people.
(The registered developed activities were the following: walking, running, getting up, sitting down, standing, falling down and lying)

This way, the app enables family members and caregivers to detect abnormal behaviors of the user who has the mobile device through alarms which are received via computer and personal mobile.

Used Programming Languages: **Objective-C**, **Java**, **Javascript**, **HTML5**, **CSS**, **Arduino** and **Matlab**.


# Honors & Awards
Finalist and primer second prize in my final master's degree "Detection and prediction of abnormal physical activities over people who have some dependency needs".


# Hackhaton
With the main goal of promoting new trends in the digital banking sector, I developed a mobile application able to detect those nearest mobile phone
devices in order to make possible to proceed with transferences among them in a quick, comfortable an secure way.
We added a security layer that enabled the validation of the operations from the smartwatch.

Technical OAuth 2.0 and Banc Sabadell API Rest knowledge acquired to proceed with the requirements of the competitions.


# Applications released

#### PebbleVideo
Up to now people has created more than **60.000 videos** through this app.
It can be defined as an iOS Application that allows users to generate videos by controlling its creation a smartwatch pebble remotely.  There are buttons with a wide range of different functionality that includes stop, pause, continue or save the video.

#### LinkedMesh
LinkedMesh ables you to increase your networking circle by detecting the professionals you have around and you are interested to contact with by adding them to the app and to your LinkedIn profile simultaneously without the need of having internet.
Forget about all those professional cards your don’t remember where you left and recognize clearly the people you have contacted with.
