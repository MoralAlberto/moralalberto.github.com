couples and see a wall with the items shares like photos, videos, events, etc.

### Research at Department of Telecommunications, UAB
The Goal of the Project: ***Detection and prediction of abnormal physical activities over people who have some dependency needs*** (old people or disabled people)
through Machine Learning techniques adapted to Smartphone.
**The Project was focused on a first data collecting received from the mobile device accelerometer and its further data sending to a server**.
This server was the one which detected the activity by the user registered trough Machine Learning.
<br/>
<br/>
While developing this project, the research team opted for a new concept based on teleassistance technologies which enables users to monitor the physical activity of other people.
(The registered developed activities were the following: walking, running, getting up, sitting down, standing, falling down and lying)
<br/>
<br/>
This way, the app enables family members and caregivers to detect abnormal behaviors of the user who has the mobile device through alarms which are received via computer and personal mobile.
<br/>
<br/>
Used Programming Languages: **Objective-C**, **Java**, **Javascript**, **HTML5**, **CSS**, **Arduino** and **Matlab**.
<br/>
<br/>

# Honors & Awards

# Hackhaton - Instant banking hack day
With the main goal of promoting new trends in the digital banking sector, I developed a mobile application able to detect those nearest mobile phone
devices in order to make possible to proceed with transferences among them in a quick, comfortable an secure way.
We added a security layer that enabled the validation of the operations from the smartwatch.
